documentation for cooper hewitt's documentation

This repository will aim to help Cooper Hewitt do a better job of documenting all of the code it authros, builds and deploys.

This is the public version. Here are a few basic guidelines.

* Every repo should have a README.md file in the root. In many cases this file can serve as the only documentation file, and that is ok. The README.md should at least outline the project and present basic installation and use instructions.
* For more complicated projects, more .md files are fine.
* For even more complicated projects, and especially for projects that may be of interest to the public, we will generate a static documentation website using Jekyll and the guidelines outlined in this repo.
* Descriptions & links to documentation files and sites should be included in the README.md
* For projects with Jekyll based documentation, the source should be contained in a "docs" folder in the root on the master branch. This can be used to generate a static site on the gh-pages branch for use with GitHub Pages.
* Jekyll based documentation sites should be located at http://cooperhewitt.github.io/<project-name>
