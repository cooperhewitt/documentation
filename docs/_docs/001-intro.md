# Introduction

Welcome to [Cooper Hewitt](http://www.cooperhewitt.org) documentation. This website documents how we document the work we author, build and deploy at Cooper Hewitt. It is primarily a boiler plate with instructions, guidelines and tips on building documentation for any project at Cooper Hewitt.

For most projects a simple README.md will be just enough documentation, but for more complex projects, it may make sense to build a small static website like this one to document all of the details. For these larger or more complex projects we simply use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as a static site generator to build the documentation pages within each project's master branch.
